/**
 * Binding metadata for the properties behind the Key Vault property source.
 *
 * {@code KeyVaultEnvironmentPostProcessor} runs before there is an application
 * context and reads its own configuration with a plain {@code Binder} over
 * {@link AzureKeyVaultSecretProperties}. Nothing in the framework can infer
 * that, and the auto-configuration that would otherwise contribute the binding
 * metadata for the same type never matches here: it is conditional on
 * {@code spring.cloud.azure.keyvault[.secret].endpoint}, while this application
 * only configures an endpoint under {@code ...secret.property-sources[0]}.
 *
 * Without members, {@code JavaBeanBinder} binds nothing, and because an absent
 * binding is indistinguishable from an empty configuration the post-processor
 * quietly decides there are no property sources to add. The failure surfaces
 * only much later, and only in the prod profile, as every secret-backed
 * placeholder being unresolvable - {@code ${db-url}} and
 * {@code ${withings-client-id}} among them.
 *
 * Only the prod profile reads secrets from Key Vault, so no test covers this.
 * After changing anything about the Key Vault configuration, check that the
 * generated
 * {@code target/spring-aot/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/**}{@code /reachability-metadata.json}
 * still carries both property types with their accessors. To check the hints by
 * hand, build the native image and start it with {@code AZURE_KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT}
 * pointing at an unreachable host: with the metadata in place the
 * post-processor binds the property source and fails on the connection, which
 * is the proof it did not skip. Silently reaching the first unresolvable
 * placeholder instead means the binding is gone again. The AOT-on-JVM run
 * cannot show this - reflection always works there.
